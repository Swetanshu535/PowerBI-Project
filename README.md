# PowerBI-Project

This Power BI dashboard visualizes the environmental and labor impact of top fashion brands across various countries. It showcases critical metrics such as carbon emissions, landfill waste, average working hours, release cycles, and workforce distribution. The dashboard integrates bar charts, donut charts, and slicers to enable dynamic filtering by brand and country. Key insights into fast fashion’s sustainability challenges were derived using DAX measures and relationship modeling. The report serves as a powerful tool for identifying the highest contributors to environmental harm and supports decision-making for ethical fashion policies.

Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze fashion brands’ carbon emissions, waste generation, and labor metrics.

Utilized DAX functions and data modeling to generate dynamic insights with slicers and drill-down capabilities.

Provided actionable visual storytelling to highlight sustainability issues across countries and brands.
